Hi there! I am an electrical engineer with a passion for wireless communication and embedded systems. I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (<a href="https://csem.ch">CSEM</a>), on embedded machine learning for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

In 2020, I obtained a <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/663278">PhD</a> on Visible Light Communication (VLC) at KU Leuven, Belgium. I aimed to translate theoretic concepts into practical applications, to show the full potential of optical wireless communication. I was an active member as Chairman and Treasurer of the IEEE Student Branch Leuven. During my PhD studies, I did an internship at Signify (formerly known as Philips Lighting) in Eindhoven, and an internship at IMDEA Networks Institute in Madrid working on the open-source OpenVLC framework. I got my MSc degree in Electrical Engineering and BSc in Engineering from KU Leuven in 2016 and 2014, respectively.

Next to the technical aspect, I also love to tell the world why science is interesting and how it can improve our lives. I participated to various science communication events, such as the Vlaamse PhD Cup, the Arenberg Festival and the summer school “Let’s Talk Science”.

In my free time, I volunteer for the Belgian organization Auxilia to help underprivileged students to get better grades in sciences. And oh yes, I love running, cycling, and… good strong coffee! So if you want to grab a coffee, let me know! :-)
