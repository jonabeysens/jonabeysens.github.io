Hi there! I I am an Assistant Professor at KU Leuven at the campus Group T, and affiliated with the Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics (STADIUS) at the Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT). In this role, I am leading research activities on HW-aware Embedded AI for innovative healthcare applications. Before, I worked as a Senior R&D Engineer at the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (<a href="https://csem.ch">CSEM</a>) in Switzerland, focusing on Edge AI for low-power tiny embedded devices to improve the intelligence of the IoT devices of tomorrow.

In 2020, I obtained a <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/663278">PhD</a> on Visible Light Communication (VLC) at KU Leuven, Belgium. I aimed to translate theoretic concepts into practical applications, to show the full potential of optical wireless communication. I was an active member as Chairman and Treasurer of the IEEE Student Branch Leuven. During my PhD studies, I did an internship at Signify (formerly known as Philips Lighting) in Eindhoven, and an internship at IMDEA Networks Institute in Madrid working on the open-source OpenVLC framework. I got my MSc degree in Electrical Engineering and BSc in Engineering from KU Leuven in 2016 and 2014, respectively.

Next to the technical aspect, I also love to tell the world why science is interesting and how it can improve our lives. I participated to various science communication events, such as the Vlaamse PhD Cup, the Arenberg Festival and the summer school “Let’s Talk Science”.

In my free time, I love running, cycling, and… a good strong espresso! ;-)
